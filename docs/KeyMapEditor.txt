                      Vcc KeyMap Editor 
                   Description of operation

The Vcc key map editor consists of two main components; the Vcc 
Custom Keyboard Map file and the Edit Custom Key Map dialog. 
These are discussed below.

Vcc Custom Keyboard Map File
----------------------------

The keyboard map file is used to map host PC key codes into Color
Computer 3 keys. This file has the default name "custom.keymap" and
resides in the user's Vcc appdata directory.  The file contains
lines of text and can be edited using Notepad if that is desired.

Each line contains four fields (two pairs) seperated by one or 
more spaces or tabs.  Blank lines, lines starting with "#", 
or anything on a line beyond four fields are comments. The first 
two fields on each non-comment line are the PC code and it's 
modifier.  The second two fields are the CoCo key and it's 
modifier.

PC keynames start with "DIK_" and CoCo key names start with 
"COCO_".  Key modifiers are specified with a single digit as
follows:  

    0=not modified, 1=shift,  2=control, 3=alt.  

A list of valid PC and CoCo key names can be found in keynames.h 
in Vcc sources.

Here are some example entry lines:

# PC key name   Mod   CoCo name  Mod
# -----------   ---  ----------- ---
  DIK_EQUALS     0   COCO_MINUS   1    # "=" Coco
  DIK_MINUS      1   COCO_MINUS   2    # "_" NitrOS-9

This above example maps the "Equals" key on the host PC to 
"Shift" + "-" keys in Vcc and the "Shift" + "-" keys on the 
host PC keyboard to "Alt" + "-" keys in Vcc.  This matches
what is printed on the keycaps of many keyboards with what
the CoCo uses.

The file contents are loaded into Vcc when the KeyBoard Mapping
is changed to "Custom" in the Vcc Options "Keyboard" tab dialog.
If the file does not exist Vcc will use default values for the 
custom keymapping.  In this later case the "Select File" function
in the Edit Custom Key Map Dialog can be used to generate the
file.

Any CoCo key that is not mapped in the keymap file will be 
"dead" in Vcc.  However shifted letter keys do not need to be
mapped to make them uppercase because DECB and NitrOS-9 will
handle this internally.

Whenever Vcc updates the keymap file all comments after the first
valid map entry will be removed.  This means user comments should
be confined to the head of the file.  Also entry order may be 
changed by the Edit Custom Key Map dialog. 

Edit Custom Key Map dialog
--------------------------

The edit key map dialog is activated by clicking the EDIT button
in the Vcc Options "Keyboard" tab dialog. The dialog has a virtual 
Color Computer 3 keyboard, a file name text box, a CoCo Key text
box, and Host Key text box,  and the following buttons:

  "Save Keymap"  Used to save key map modfications to keymap file
  "Select File"  Used to select the keymap file to use.
  "Set"          Used to modify a key mapping in Vcc
  "Clear"        Used to clear out the CoCo and Host text boxes 
  "Exit"         Used to exit the dialog.

Other than selecting which PC key and modifier to map the dialog
can not be navigated using the PC keyboard.  Buttons can only be
activated with a pointing device or touch keyboard.

Once the dialog is entered pressing any key on the PC keyboard will
cause the corresponding key button on the virtual CoCo keyboard to
be pushed in and text describing the keys to appear in the CoCo 
Key and Host Key text boxes. If the PC key has no mapping the
CoCo key text box will be blank and no button on the virtual CoCo
keyboard will be pushed.  Keys toggle - if the same key is pressed
twice it toggled on-off.  Modifier keys can be toggled either 
before or after non-modifier keys. This functionality allows user 
to quickly toggle through various PC key combinations to see the 
Vcc mapping of each.

To change a keymapping user first selects a PC key and optional
modifier by the above method and then clicks on a key button(s) 
on the virtual CoCo keyboard. This causes the "Set" button to 
become active.  One the desired keymapping is seen clicking the
"Set" button commits the mapping to Vcc.  If instead the "Clear"
button is clicked or any PC key is pushed the "Set" button will
be deactivated and the keymap change is canceled.

Changing the mapping of a key by the above method is temporary
until the change is saved to the keymap file using the 
"Save Keymap" button (which activates if the keymap has been
changed).  It is considered normal to leave the Edit Key Map
dialog without saving a map change.  This allows user to use
the change for the duration of the session without having it
be permanant.

The keymap file name can be changed with the "Select File" button.
Pressing this button brings up an open file dialog which allows
user to choose a different keymap file.  When a file is selected
the current custom keymapping is automatically saved to it.  If
the file selected does not exist the user is prompted if they 
want to create it.
